# Alert Overlays
This folder contains the base for the Alert Overlays, along with all the different alert modules I have added.

# Installation
1. Download all files and folders.
2. In AlertOverlayBase.html, change streamername to your channel name and uncomment the names of the modules you want to enable

# Issues
+ Heart sprites from SubBomb appear offset from where they should be

# Things I might add in the future
+ More sub bomb logic?
