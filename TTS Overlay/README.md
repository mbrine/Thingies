# INSTALLATION

1. Rename the file to your twitch channel's name (Not case-sensitive)
2. Add the file as a browser source in your streaming software

# Issues
+ There seems to be a bug where the first message gets skipped due to no voices, likely will have TTS say a blank message on startup if I can't find a way to fix this.

# Things I might add in the future
+ A "whoosh" or "ping" sound when a message is received, obviously that would mean I can't contain everything in 1 file (unless I use an audio source from online? hmm...)
