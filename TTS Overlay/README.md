# Known Issues
+ There seems to be a bug where the first message gets skipped due to no voices being available, likely will have TTS say a blank message on startup if I can't find a way to fix this.

# Things I might add in the future
+ A "whoosh" or "ping" sound when a message is received, obviously that would mean I can't contain everything in 1 file (unless I use an audio source from online? hmm...)
+ Other languages? (I would need a way to detect what language is being used in the message.)
